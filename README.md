# clox

## About
clox is my implementation of Robert Nystrom's scripting language 'clox' using a bytecode virtual machine. It includes a tokenizer and parser for the language, as well as a compiler and the virtual machine interpreter. It supports a REPL as well as running scripts from file. This project is currently implemented up to chapter 22 ("Local Variables") of Nystrom's book, "Crafting Interpreters".
