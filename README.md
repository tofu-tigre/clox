# clox

## About
clox is my implementation of Robert Nystrom's scripting language "Lox" using a bytecode virtual machine. It includes a tokenizer and parser for the language, as well as a compiler and the virtual machine interpreter. It supports a REPL as well as running local scripts from file. This project is currently implemented up to chapter 22 ("Local Variables") of Nystrom's book, "Crafting Interpreters". 

## How to Use
Simply download the repository into your own local folder and run "make" in your terminal. This project is currently configured for Windows 10. I personally am using Git Bash. The projecte executable will be located in the "bin" folder as "clox.exe".
